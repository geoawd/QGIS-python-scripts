# QGIS-python-scripts
Some useful python scripts for QGIS.

## COG's
There are scripts to load a list of cogs to QGIS.

Additional files for processing COGS:
- DownloadProcessCOG.py - this downlaods a zip file and processes the data.
- AnalyseCOGpy - this extracts no data min and max values for a list of input files. Useful for identifying the files that need to be further processed.
- ConvertCOG.py - converts the 2012 data which is in mm and -9999 no data values to metres and -99 no data values.

All work in progress.
